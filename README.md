# Reddit Web Scraper

## Goal
Reddit is a huge exosystem brimming with data that is readily available. As a data scientist in financial industry, I would like to know how popular a certain stock or options product is in social media. I would take the advantage of Reddit API access to extract posts and comments by keyword. The results from the reddit web scraping can be further used as a feature and applied into another machine learning project to analyze the key drivers of options volume growth.

## Objectives:
* Demonstrate how to create a Reddit API account.
* Demonstrade how to extract posts and comments through pre-defined keywords by accessing Reddit API.
    * understand how many times per day people talk about SPX 0DTE options in Reddit. This will become a feature in another machine learning project to see if the popularity in social media can be a key driver of volume growth for SPX 0DTE options .
